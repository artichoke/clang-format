# `clang-format` binary distributions

This directory includes pre-built binaries for `clang-format` on the following
platforms:

- Apple x86_64, arm64
- Linux x86_64
- Windows win32

Embedded binaries are official or snapshot releases of the LLVM project. Each
platform documents the source of the binary.

This package embeds `clang-format` for ease of distribution and to minimize
