# Contributing to Artichoke – clang-format Runner

👋 Hi and welcome to [Artichoke]. Thanks for taking the time to contribute!
💪💎🙌

Artichoke aspires to be a [recent MRI Ruby][mri-target]-compatible
implementation of the Ruby programming language. [There is lots to do].

[mri-target]:
  https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/blob/trunk/RUBYSPEC.md#mri-target

The Artichoke `clang-format` runner is used to lint C sources in development and
CI.

If Artichoke does not run Ruby source code in the same way that MRI does, it is
a bug and we would appreciate if you [filed an issue so we can fix it]. [File
bugs specific to the Artichoke `clang-format` runner in this repository].

If you would like to contribute code to the Artichoke `clang-format` runner
👩‍💻👨‍💻, find an issue that looks interesting and leave a comment that you're
beginning to investigate. If there is no issue, please file one before beginning
to work on a PR. [Good first issues are labeled `E-easy`].

## Setup

The Artichoke `clang-format` runner includes JavaScript and Text sources.
Developing on the runner requires configuring several dependencies.

### Node.js

The Artichoke `clang-format` runner is implemented in Node.js, which is required
for running it.

Node.js is an optional dependency that is used for formatting text sources with
[prettier].

Node.js is only required for formatting if modifying the following filetypes:

- `md`
- `yaml`
- `yml`

You will need to install [Node.js].

On macOS, you can install Node.js with [Homebrew]:

```sh
brew install node
```

## Linting

```sh
npm run fmt
```

## Updating Dependencies

Regular dependency bumps are handled by [@dependabot].
